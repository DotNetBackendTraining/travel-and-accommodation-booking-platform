# Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform

[![.NET and Docker](https://github.com/DotNetBackendTraining/travel-and-accommodation-booking-platform/actions/workflows/build-test-push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DotNetBackendTraining/travel-and-accommodation-booking-platform/actions/workflows/build-test-push.yml)

# Introduction

We are thrilled to present to you a hands-on project where you'll be responsible for designing and implementing the APIs
for an advanced online hotel booking system. Your task is to develop a series of APIs that will drive the core
functionalities of various components of the platform, including the Login Page, Home Page, Search Results, Hotel
Details, Secure Checkout, and Admin Management.

We encourage you to thoroughly read and understand the project features outlined in the documentation. Your challenge is
to translate these features into efficient, secure, and well-structured APIs. These APIs should follow RESTful
principles and be designed with clean code practices in mind.

Key aspects of your development should include robust error handling, secure JWT authentication, effective user
permissions management, and comprehensive unit testing. These elements are crucial for ensuring the reliability and
maintainability of your code.

Additionally, your ability to manage this project effectively using tools like Jira will be crucial. This project
management aspect is vital for tracking progress, managing tasks, and ensuring timely delivery of your work.

This project is not just about coding; it's an opportunity for you to engage in the full lifecycle of software
development, from conception to deployment. We are excited to see how you interpret the requirements and look forward to
your innovative approaches to these challenges.

Dive into the project, bring your best ideas to the forefront, and let's create a remarkable online booking experience
together!
